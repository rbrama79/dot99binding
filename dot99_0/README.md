# IEEE P1451.99.0 IECON2022 Demo

During 2023 IECON Demo we've shown it is possible to register devices and
to interact with them by means of JSON objects. The P1451.99.0 is based
on two abstraciton layers, HARL and SGI, that interact -- through JSON
object -- with the P1451.99 network on HARL side, and with non-1451
devices on SGI side.

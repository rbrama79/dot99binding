======================================

Superflous rdf:about
-----------------------

Following statement generates superflous triple:

```
<ieee1451:NCAP rdf:about="http://iml.ubi.pt/2022/ieee1451/#NCAP">
```

as it says that `http://iml.ubi.pt/2022/ieee1451/#NCAP` is a `http://iml.ubi.pt/2022/ieee1451/#NCAP`.

Generated Graph
-------------------

The RDF generates the following semantic graph:

![Graph of Example RDF file](ReadTEDSExample.png)

Rules for how graph was generated:

* Subjects shown as objects in object diagram.
* Literals shown as properties on objects
* Predicates are shown as labels on links to objects, or as property names.
* Prefixed short names used instead of fully qualified names, for readability.
* rdf:type shown as stereotype on object definition.
* Links from blank nodes are shown as aggregations.


Use of blank nodes for TIMs
------------------------------

Use of Blank Nodes in RDF does not allow for addressing TIMs individually. The TIMS are
physical objects (right?) that should be adressable using linked data directly. As blank
nodes they are only addressable in a specific context (as the RDF document itself).


On identity of NCAP
-----------------------

The RDF document begins with defining `http://iml.ubi.pt/2022/ieee1451/#NCAP`. Is this
assumed to be an example identity? Or are all NCAPs reporting the same URI?

rbrama: This is, indeed, a nice question. In IEEE P1451.0 we suppose to identify APPs, NCAPs and TIMs by means of their UUID. 
Please note UUIDs have been modified since last official 1451.0 and they are longer (128b). Now, IMHO the NCAP will share the
URI identifying their semantic descriptor URI while they MUST be logically (1451.0) addressable by means of the UUID. How to
bind UUIDs with real URLs or JIDs (in case of .99) is to be discussed
   

Use of xml:base
------------------

Use of xml:base should be used, esp. since document is not retrieved using HTTP GET (where
base URI is implicit). By using xml:base in all such RDF documents, you avoid any concerns
of genering documents that are not well-defined.

has-properties
-----------------

### ieee1451:hasTIM

The name of predicate `ieee1451:hasTIM` is counter-intuitive. Sounds like a Boolean property,
but is a collection of TIM blank node objects. Name Suggestion: `ieee1451:TIMs`.

### ieee1451:hasUsersTransducerNameTEDS

The name of predicate `ieee1451:hasUsersTransducerNameTEDS` is counter-intuitive. Sounds like a Boolean property,
but is a collection of User Transducer Name TED blank node objects. Name Suggestion: `ieee1451:UsersTransducerNameTEDS`.

### ieee1451:hasTransducerChannelTEDS

The name of predicate `ieee1451:hasTransducerChannelTEDS` is counter-intuitive. Sounds like a Boolean property,
but is a collection of Transducer Channel TED blank node objects. Name Suggestion: `ieee1451:TransducerChannelTEDS`.

### ieee1451:hasMetaTEDS

The name of predicate `ieee1451:hasMetaTEDS` is counter-intuitive. Sounds like a Boolean property,
but is a collection of Meta TED blank node objects. Name Suggestion: `ieee1451:MetaTEDS`.

Collections/Sets/Sequences
------------------------------

For sets of objects (samples, TEDs, etc., consider using semantic web standard collections.
This includes declarying type of collection (rdf:Bag, rdf:Seq, etc.), and using rdf:li
list-item predicates.

Unintuitive names
--------------------

Following predicate names are unintuitive:

* `cGroup`
* `grpType`
* `memList`

Data Types of encoded values
-------------------------------

Encoded values should have data type specified. Nwo they are all string literals.

Sample values & units
-------------------------

It is a common implementation strategy to implement a physical magnitute as a collection
of two (or more) fields, at least including magnitute as a numeric value, and unit as a 
string or enumeration. Another alternative is to use the unit as field name (predicate) and
magnitute as value (object literal). This makes all kinds of processing of sample data difficult.

If a two-field approach is used, you can have multiple sample values using the same unit,
but meaning sligly different things: Example: Reporting Voltage in a 3-phase volt-meter often
requires 4 fields using the `V` unit (a total, and one for each phase). Typically, there are
even more fields. Difficulty is creating understandable queries however, and unit conversion.

If a one-field (or predicate) approach is used, queries become simpler, but it is more difficult
to encode meter samples where multiple fields use the same unit. Predicate ovarloads can be
used, but considering use of different units, complexity grows.

An alternative is the ability of semantic web to define data types, that include magnitude
and unit into a single semantic literal value.

Example: Consider a Heat Meter, reporting 3 kinds of temperatures: Flow Temperature (into
the system), Return Temperature (out from system) and Temperature differente (often a magnitute
higher precision, otherwise flow-return temperature). Flow and return temperatures are often
measured in degrees C or F, while difference is often measured in K. But not always.

Consider the complexity of making a semantic query, of retrieving all heat meters reporting
a temperature difference less than 10 degrees C or K (18 degrees F). Apart from having to
struggle with unit conversion, three different temperature field values have to be analyzed.

If instead of having a same value defined as:

```
[ieee1451:FlowTemp "somevalue"^^xsd:decimal;
 ieee1451:FlowTempUnit "someunit";
 ieee1451:ReturnTemp "somevalue"^^xsd:decimal;
 ieee1451:ReturnTempUnit "someunit";
 ieee1451:TempDiff "somevalue"^^xsd:decimal;
 ieee1451:TempDiffUnit "someunit"]
```

or

```
[ieee1451:FlowTempC "somevalue"^^xsd:decimal;
 ieee1451:ReturnTempC "somevalue"^^xsd:decimal;
 ieee1451:TempDiffK "somevalue"^^xsd:decimal]
```

it could be encoded as:

```
[ieee1451:FlowTemp "somevalue"^^ieee1451:C;
 ieee1451:ReturnTemp "somevalue"^^ieee1451:C;
 ieee1451:TempDiff "somevalue"^^ieee1451:K]
```

This would have the following benefits: Reasoners would be able to perform processing
with implicit unit conversion, meaning interoperability between devices using different
physical units on all levels. If a reasoner did not understand the physical unit data types
they could still process information, but as string literals, without making numerical
processing errors, that could occur when mixing units.

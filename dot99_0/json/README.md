# JSON Object Exchanges in Primitives

In P1451.99.0 JSON objects are used as the unique data format exchanged in communication 
primitives. Each one of those admits different JSON objects. Some of those have been
showcased during IECON 2022 Demonstration

## HARmonization Layer (HARL)

	This layer is used to abstract the binding towards the P.99 network. The XMPP network will 
	trigger, by means of a XMPP message, an invocation to one of the HARL primitives towards the
	binding gateway. On the other side, if the binding desires to send data towards the P.99 network
	it will do that by means of an appropriate primitive receiving a JSON object that will
	be translated in the appropriate XMPP stanza. Examples of JSON objects shown during the 
	demo are listed below:

	* [HARL-Set_Req](harl-set-req.json)
	* [HARL-Set_Conf](harl-set-conf.json)
	
##  Specific Gateway Interface (SGI)

	This layer abstracts the non-1451 technology that needs to be bound to the 1451 family 
	by means of the binding gateway. The binding gateway will invoke specific primitives towards the 
	SGI layer requesting a JSON object as argument. The same will be done as soon as one of the abstracted 
	non-1451 need to interact with the P.99 network. JSON object shown during the 2022 IECON demo are
	listed here below.
